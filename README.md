# Predictive Modeling Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast outcomes based on historical data. The models can be applied to various domains such as finance, healthcare, retail, and more.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-modeling.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd predictive-modeling`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Install the required libraries mentioned above.
3. Prepare your dataset (e.g., financial data, customer behavior data).
4. Update the Python script (`predictive_modeling.py`) with your data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation code.
5. Run the Python script to execute the predictive modeling tasks.
6. Review the evaluation metrics and adjust the model as needed.

## Files

- `predictive_modeling.py`: Python script containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies needed for this project.

## Approach

1. **Data Preparation**: Load your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocess it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features (e.g., customer demographics, transaction history) to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) based on the problem and data characteristics.
4. **Model Training**: Train the selected model using the training dataset to capture patterns and relationships.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error.
6. **Model Validation**: Validate the model's predictions through visualizations and statistical analysis.
